# Progress

## What Works
- âœ… Basic predicate structure with EqualityPredicateAlkane
- âœ… Initialization sequence with proper guards
- âœ… MessageDispatch setup for opcode handling
- âœ… Basic validation logic for incoming alkanes
- âœ… Error handling framework
- âœ… Project structure reorganized into monorepo

## What's Left to Build
- ðŸ”„ Comprehensive test suite
- ðŸ”„ Complete validation logic implementation
- ðŸ”„ Edge case handling
- ðŸ”„ Usage examples and documentation
- ðŸ”„ Additional error handling improvements

## Current Status
The project has been started with the basic structure in place and has been reorganized into a monorepo structure. The core functionality is being implemented with a focus on security and validation accuracy, but testing and refinement are still needed before production use.

### Implemented Features
1. **Core Predicate Functionality**
   - Initialization with proper guards
   - Basic validation structure
   - Error handling framework

2. **Security Measures**
   - Initialization guard via observe_initialization()
   - Basic validation of incoming alkanes
   - Error handling with descriptive messages

3. **Code Structure**
   - MessageDispatch derive macro for opcode handling
   - EqualityPredicate trait for common functionality
   - AlkaneResponder implementation
   - Monorepo organization with separate crates

### Implementation Details
- The EqualityPredicateAlkane struct implements the core contract logic
- The EqualityPredicate trait provides common functionality
- MessageDispatch handles opcode routing
- Storage pointers manage persistent state
- The project is organized as a crate within the alkanes workspace

## Known Issues
- No comprehensive test suite yet
- Validation logic needs refinement
- Error messages may need improvement

## Next Milestones
1. **Complete Implementation** - Finish the validation logic implementation
2. **Test Suite** - Create comprehensive tests for all operations
3. **Documentation** - Create usage examples and deployment instructions
4. **Code Review** - Review and refine the implementation
5. **Release** - Prepare for production release
6. **Additional Predicates** - Implement other predicate types in the monorepo

## Blockers
- None currently identified

## Recent Achievements
- Initial project setup
- Basic structure implementation
- Memory-bank documentation creation
- Reorganization into monorepo structure
