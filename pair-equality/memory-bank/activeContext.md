# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on implementing a secure and efficient predicate alkane contract that enforces the quantities of alkanes sent to it in a two-party trade. The implementation is based on the requirements specified in the project brief and aims to provide reliable validation functionality.

## Recent Changes
- **Initial Implementation**: Created the basic structure for the EqualityPredicateAlkane
  - Added MessageDispatch derive macro for opcode handling
  - Implemented proper initialization guard via observe_initialization()
  - Added validation logic for incoming alkanes
  - Implemented error handling with descriptive messages
- Set up project structure with necessary dependencies
- Created memory-bank documentation
- **Project Restructuring**: Moved the predicate implementation to a monorepo structure
  - Created alkanes workspace with pair-equality as a crate
  - Updated package names and dependencies
  - Reorganized file structure for better maintainability

## Active Decisions

### Validation Implementation
- Using validation logic to enforce exactly two alkanes in the transaction
- Implementing specific sequence and amount validation for both parties
- Providing clear error messages when validation fails

### Storage Design
- Using dedicated storage pointer for initialization state
- Keeping the storage footprint minimal for efficiency

### Interface Design
- Using MessageDispatch derive macro for cleaner opcode handling
- Implementing a simple and focused opcode interface
- Adding comprehensive error handling for all operations

### Monorepo Structure
- Organizing related alkane contracts under a single workspace
- Maintaining separate crates for different predicate types
- Sharing common patterns and utilities across predicates

## Next Steps

### Implementation Tasks
1. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive test suite for all operations
   - Test edge cases for validation logic
   - Verify compatibility with existing systems

2. **Code Refinement**
   - Review error handling for clarity and completeness
   - Ensure all validation logic is robust
   - Add additional comments and documentation

3. **Documentation**
   - Create usage examples for contract interaction
   - Document validation requirements for users
   - Add deployment instructions

### Open Questions
- Should we implement additional validation parameters beyond sequence and amount?
- Is there a need for more sophisticated error reporting?
- Should we add a mechanism to update validation parameters after initialization?
- What other predicate types should be added to the monorepo?

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring the validation logic correctly handles all edge cases
- Providing clear and actionable error messages
- Maintaining compatibility with the broader alkane ecosystem
- Coordinating development across multiple predicate types in the monorepo
