# Product Context

## Purpose
The pair-equality.wasm project exists to provide a secure and efficient implementation of a predicate alkane contract that enforces the quantities of alkanes sent to it in a two-party trade. It follows current best practices and security patterns while delivering reliable validation functionality.

## Problem Statement
In alkane-based systems, there's a need to enforce specific rules for transactions involving multiple parties. This predicate contract addresses this need by validating that transactions contain exactly two alkanes with specific sequence numbers and amounts, ensuring that trades follow predetermined rules.

## User Experience Goals
- Users should be able to rely on the predicate to enforce trade rules
- The contract should provide clear error messages when validation fails
- The contract should enforce security measures transparently
- The contract should be compatible with existing alkane systems

## Key Features
1. **Validation Functionality**
   - Enforces exactly two alkanes in the transaction
   - Validates specific sequence numbers and amounts for both parties
   - Provides clear error messages when validation fails

2. **Secure Implementation**
   - Proper initialization guard via observe_initialization()
   - Overflow validation for all numeric operations
   - Comprehensive error handling

## Stakeholders
- Developers building on the alkane ecosystem
- Users engaging in two-party trades
- System integrators implementing trade validation
- Security auditors verifying the implementation
